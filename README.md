# etch-a-sketch

My second Javascript project!

With this project, I got more comfortable working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's a grid where each cell changes color and gets more opaque when you hover over it. Plus, the grid is customizable â€” you can choose the number of cells per side by clicking a button at the top.

Along with practicing my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, I also applied my newly acquired skills:

- DOM Manipulation
- DOM Events
- Git Branching

Most importantly, this project allowed me to improve my problem-solving skills and write cleaner code!
